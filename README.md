## Task description

Code represents POC of Visit Management Page.
<br/><br/>Patient can see a visit date with the option to book a new appointment but provided solution does not meet all
business requirements and has a few bugs.

### Issues to resolve:

- fix fetching available slots
- apply correct date / time formatting to the slot element to make it more readable (only time should be displayed)

### The goal is to improve patient's experience by:

- grouping slots by day
- when user clicks on a slot, booking action is triggered. Set up a confirmation step before booking new slot
- adding loading state of your choice when slot is being booked
- update confirmed date and available slots to avoid double bookings (two bookings for the same hour)

## Hints

- it's up to you how much time you want to spend
- feel free to refactor and reorganise the code as you feel like
- add any libraries that you might need
- add tests
- if you could do something better, but it feels like too much work - please put a comment and describe what would you
  do

### **Good luck!**
